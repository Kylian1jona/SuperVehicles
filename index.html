            <h2>Bugatti Tourbillion(Supercar)</h2>
              <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2026-bugatti-tourbillon-104-66709d54aa287.jpg?crop=0.819xw:0.692xh;0.0994xw,0.185xh&resize=1200:*" alt="">
              <p class="text-justify border-primary">
                The 2026 Tourbillon is the first completely new design from Bugatti since the brand merged with electric sports car maker
                 Rimac in 2021, and it replaces the mega-powered Chiron in the company's lineup. With a staggering price tag of $4.6 million,
                  customers will expect a special vehicle, and they'll find it in the Tourbillon's sculpted curves and custom-made V-16 engine
                  . The Tourbillon adds three electric motors to the multi-cylinder gas powerplant, for an astounding total of 1775 horsepower—more
                   than any previous Bugatti model. The interior is all about the tactile experience, with luxury materials like leather,
                    machined metal, and crystal. The Tourbillon sets aside ideas of self-driving and screen-heavy in-car entertainment in
                     favor of ananalog driving experience that calls back to the earliest days of the Bugatti brand, only much faster.

      <p style="text-align: center;">It may be slightly cheaper than the Phantom, but there's nothing cheap about the 2024 Rolls-Royce Ghost. From tip to tail,<br>
         this luxury limo exudes glamour and sophistication. A V-12 engine provides effortless acceleration, but while it's capable of hitting 60 mph in a brisk 4.6<br>
          seconds and offers a surprising level of athleticism for its size, the Ghost is better used for gently ferrying its power-player passengers to and from board<br> 
          meetings and exclusive social functions. A camera scans the road ahead to help prepare the suspension for potholes and speed bumps to keep the ride as velvety as<br>
           possible. That gives passengers the ability to sip champagne and snack on caviar without spilling anything onto the Ghost's buttery-soft leather or high-pile <br>
           lambswool floormats. Ready to live your Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous fantasy? With a small investment of around $400,000, the Ghost can take up residence in<br>
            your driveway, but remember—the chauffeur is sold separately. </p>

            <h2>Dodge Challenger(Coupe)</h2>
            <p>The Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat is where tires go to die. It’s<br>
                 one of the last coupes with American-style V-8 thunder under <br>
                 its hood. The Challenger SRT Hellcat lineup’s most reserved <br>
                 model spews 717 horsepower from its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8<br>
                  engine. But there’s so much more: output from the Hellcat Redeye model’s<br>
                   version of this engine jumps to 797 horsepower. And the meanest,<br>
                    nastiest Hellcat Redeye, the Widebody Jailbreak edition, deploys <br>
                    807 horsepower. All Challenger SRT Hellcats help you toward a s<br>
                    uspended license with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed <br>
                    automatic transmission; rear-wheel-drive is the only configuration <br>
                    offered and is one that is always ready to deploy billows of smoke<br>
                     from each of its massive, 12-inch-wide rear tires. While souped-up<br>
                      rivals such as the Chevy Camaro ZL1 and Ford Mustang Shelby GT500<br>
                       are more road-course friendly, the SRT Hellcat has surface-prepared<br>
                        drag strip energy. And a lot of it. The more everyday all-wheel<br>
                         drive, V-6, and smaller V-8 equipped Challenger are reviewed separately.<br></p>

            <h2>Infiniti Q50(Sedan)</h2>
            <p>
            Infiniti's lineup isn't what it could be—or should be. Consider the brand's sole sedan, the Q50, still in its first generation after 11 years on the market. 
            That's about twice as long as most manufacturers keep models in the fight before a major redesign. The Q50's graceful exterior styling still holds up, which
             is the good news. The 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 serving every Q50 with either 300 or 400 horsepower should also be good news, but the spunky powertrains are l
             et down by the car's uninspiring handling and occasionally jittery ride. Nearly everything else about the sedan either creaks with age or betrays a lack of 
             inspiration. The infotainment system does both. Even with that, the Q50 isn't truly bad but we recommend checking out other, fresher, and more driver-centric
              entry-luxury sedans like the upstart Genesis G70 and the departing Kia Stinger—or the well-regarded old-guard German iron like the BMW 3-series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. </p> </div>

            <h2>Lexus TX350(Luxury SUV)</h2>
            <p>The 2024 TX SUV shares its platform with the Toyota Grand Highlander and is replacing the previous-generation RX-L three-row SUV in the Lexus lineup. The RX-L was never particularly roomy in the rearmost seat, but the TX offers plenty of space for adults to settle in back there. The TX offers a plethora of luxury features—the Toyota version is already plenty pleasant inside—to justify the Lexus badge, including available semi-aniline leather upholstery and a 21-speaker Mark Levinson stereo system. The TX350 is powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder, but Lexus also sells a TX500h hybrid and TX550h+ plug-in hybrid, but we review those models separately. </p>

  <h2> Toyota GR86(Sports Car)</h2>
            <p>Cars such as the Toyota GR86 are few and far between. Sure, there's its mechanical twin, the Subaru BRZ, but overall, there are very few affordable rear-wheel-drive coupes available among the sea of crossovers and SUVs. The GR86 comes with a 228-hp flat-four engine. A six-speed automatic gearbox is available, but you're best off avoiding it and sticking with the car's standard six-speed manual gearbox. This small Toyota two-door's rear seats aren't there for carpooling, but rather add additional cargo space once you've filled up its trunk. The GR86 is fun to drive anywhere thanks to its sharp steering and deft handling, two traits that helped secure it a spot on our 2024 10Best Cars list and our 2024 Editors' Choice list. Even better, it's all available at a reasonable price. </p>

<h2>Acura Integra Type S(Sports Sedan)</h2>
  <p>The hotted-up sibling to the standard Integra, the new-for-2024 Acura Integra Type S exhibits an entirely more engaging personality and delivers the kind of driving experience serious enthusiasts revel in. We're delighted that Acura made the effort to honor the brand's "Type S" high-performance legacy by stuffing the engine bay with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that delivers 320-hp, a significant 120-hp increase over the standard Integra. This is virtually the same powerplant the motivates the track-worthy Honda Civic Type R. A slick-shifting six-speed manual transmission—an automatic is not on the menu—furthers Acura's commitment to driver involvement and makes exploring the engine's 7000-rpm rev range an instinctual thrill. While the Integra Type S has commonalities with the Civic Type R hot hatchback, it feels less edgy and more mature when the pace is dialed back, thanks partly to the Type S-specific tuning of its standard adaptive dampers. That duality is one of the qualities that helped earn it a 2024 10Best award and a place on our 2024 Editors' Choice list. The Type S seamlessly blends performance and practicality with a decent-sized cargo area and adequate room for four, making it a solid value proposition and a great all-around choice for people who love to drive. </p>
